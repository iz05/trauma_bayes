This paper contains a generalization of Naive Bayes towards datasets with dependent attributes. In particular, our algorithm, Traumatized Bayes, calculates the CramerV correlation coefficient between each pair of attribute values and incorporates this correlation coefficient in calculating the conditional probability of an instance belonging to a specific class. Traumatized Bayes turns out to be more accurate than traditional Naive Bayesian methods on datasets with dependent attributes, without sacrificing accuracy on datasets with independent attributes. Furthermore, Traumatized Bayes does not sacrifice computational speed, as compared to other advanced Bayes algorithms such as Hidden Naive Bayes.
